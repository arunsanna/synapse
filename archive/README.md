# Archive

Archived artifacts that are no longer part of the active project surface.

## Why this exists

This folder keeps superseded planning notes and documentation assets available for historical context without cluttering active implementation docs.

## Current contents

- `archive/docs/UI_REVAMP_GUIDE.md`
  - Superseded by the in-code dashboard implementation and architecture docs.
- `archive/diagrams/synapse-architecture-diagram.png`
  - Older architecture export replaced by the active diagrams in `docs/diagrams/` and the source-of-truth architecture notes in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- `docs/archive/`
  - Legacy deployment/build plan docs retained in place for timeline continuity.

## Archive policy

Move files here when they are no longer operationally relevant but still valuable for history or rollback context.
